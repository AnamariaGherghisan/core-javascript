# Introduction

## What is a variable?

A variable in JavaScript is a named container that stores data values. In other words we can reference values by using the variable names associated to them. Variables are fundamental to programming because they allow you to store, modify, and retrieve data dynamically during the execution of a program.

Variables in JavaScript can be declared using three keywords: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

- **var**: Declares a variable that can be globally-scoped or function-scoped and can be re-assigned.
- **let**: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be re-assigned.
- **const**: Declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be re-assigned once it is assigned a value.

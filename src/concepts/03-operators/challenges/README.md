# Operators

## User Story

As a developer I should be able to use JavaScript operators in my codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use JavaScript operators to calculate the take home salary for a gross annual salary of `50000` where the tax free amount of `12500` is deducted and on the remaining value a percentage of `30%` is applied to calculate the tax amount which is deducted from the gross annual salary to give us the result of the take home salary of `38750`. The result should be displayed in the console using the string operator as `Your take home salary is Â£38750`.

## Getting Started

Run the following command in your terminal to start the test runner to run in watch mode.

```shell
npm run test:operators
```

Complete the code in the [challenges folder](../challenges/) and ensure that all tests are passing.

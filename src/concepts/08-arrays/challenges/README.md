# Arrays

## User Story

As a developer I should be able to use JavaScript arrays in my codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- create a function `double` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the double of each number in the array
- create a function `average` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the average of the numbers in the array
- create a function `evenNumbers` that takes in an array of numbers and returns all the even numbers in the array
- create a function `contains` that takes in an array of numbers and a number and returns true if the array contains the number and false if it does not

# Variables

## User Story

As a developer I should be able to declare variables in my codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- I should be able to declare a variable called `vehicleMake` with a string value of `"Tesla"` using the `const` variable declaration and log the value in the console.

- I should be able to declare a variable called `vehicleSpeed` with a number value of `0` using the `let` variable declaration and log the value in the console.

- I should be able reassign the value of `vehicleSpeed` to a number value of `60` and log the value in the console.

## Getting Started

Run the following command in your terminal to start the test runner to run in watch mode.

```shell
npm run test:variables
```

Complete the code in the [challenges folder](../challenges/) and ensure that all tests are passing.
